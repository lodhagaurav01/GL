Chef and his family have added a new member to their family. And now Chef is deciding to give him a new name, as it will be easy and unique for them to understand. He has a String S of length L, He want the longest homogeneous substring of S.

NOTE: A homogeneous substring is a string that consists of only one type of character.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, String S.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer Length of the longest homogeneous substring

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
2≤|S|≤109
Sample Input:
1
abbbaa
Sample Output:
3

==============================================================
n=int(input())
while n>0:
    n-=1
    a=input()
    t=1
    mx=1
    for i in range(1,len(a)):
        if a[i]!=a[i-1]:
            t=1
            continue
            
        t+=1    
        mx=max(mx,t)
      
    print(mx)
