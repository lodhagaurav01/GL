Alice and Bob as usual are going to conduct a CodeFight between two groups in their class. There are N students in their class. Every student in their class is having some programming knowledge denoted by Pi. Score of a team is decided by summing up the Pi values of each student in their teams. Now Alice and Bob want to make two teams but they want to distribute the members in the two teams such that there should be minimal difference between their Scores. Since Alice and Bob are very busy to make the setup for CodeFight event, you have to help them. Now your task is to find the Scores of the two teams according to the above condition.

Input Format

First line contain T( Number of test cases.)
Then next line contains N (Number of students in class participating in the event)
Next line contains N space seperated integers (Denoting the Scores of each Student)
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
2 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= Pi <= 100
Output Format

Print the Scores of two teams seperated by space in non-decreasing order.
Sample Input 0

2
2
2 2
4
4 2 6 0
Sample Output 0

2 2
6 6
Explanation 0

In the first case distribution is [2] and [2] so that difference is 0 (minimum possible).
In Second Test Case Distribution is [4 , 2] and [6 , 0].



n=int(input())
t=n
while t>0:
    t=t-1
    o=int(input())
    l=list(map(int,input().split()))
    l.sort(reverse=True)
    m=(sum(l)//2)
    s=s1=0
    for i in l:
        if s+i<=m:
            s+=i
        else:
            s1+=i
    print(s,s1)
