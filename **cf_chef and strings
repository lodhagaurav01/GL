Chef is playing Letter Problem with his son. In this Game, Chef will provide two Strings S1 and S2 of length l and m respectively, and he want his son to find number of different characters of s1 that are not present in s2 and vice versa.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a two line of input,
1st line contains Strings s1. of length l.
2nd line contains Strings s2. of length m
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer total number of different characters of s1 that are not present in s2 and vice versa.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤L,M≤100000
Sample Input:
1
abbdfga
accfdkop
Sample Output:
6
EXPLANATION:
b, g of s1. are not present in s2 and c, k, o, p of s2 are not present in s1.
